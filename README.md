An ongoing project to create a set of links to free online learning resources for new and experienced Software Testers.

Since computer science and IT university departments don't invariably offer dedicated software testing modules and resources are spread among various different providers linked to different methodologies, I created this project to help guide new testers into some sort of useful curriculum and collate some existing web-based resources into lists of links.

The rules I wish to implement are -

1. Content must be directly relevant to testers
1. Content must be informative and not overly "salesy"
1. Contest must be free of charge

This project is very new and the more resources are added the better. I ask the testing community to help by contacting me to offer new content or fork and create a pull request. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. In the meantime, I hope you find the resources below useful.
