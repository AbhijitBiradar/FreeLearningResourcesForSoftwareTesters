# FreeLearningResourcesForSoftwareTesters
An ongoing project to create a set of links to free online learning resources for new and experience Software Testers.

Since very few university CS departments offer dedicated software testing modules and resources are spread throughout the internet, this project exists to form a basic curriculum and collate existing web-based resources into an easily-followable format.

Please either contact me to offer new content or create a pull request.
